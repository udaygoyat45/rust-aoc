# Advent of Code 2025

This repository contains my solutions for Advent of Code 2025, implemented in Rust.

## Running Solutions

Each day's puzzle solution is designed to be run as an executable, taking the path to its input file as an argument.

To run a specific day's solution (e.g., Day 1), use the following command:

```bash
cargo run -- day01 <path/to/your/input/file.txt>
```

Replace `day01` with the module name for the specific day you want to run (e.g., `day02`, `day03`, etc.), and `<path/to/your/input/file.txt>` with the actual path to the input data for that day.
